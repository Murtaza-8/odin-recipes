    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use. Chicken Biryani is a flavorful South Asian rice dish made with fragrant basmati rice, tender chicken, and a blend of aromatic spices like cumin, cardamom, and cloves. Layered with fried onions, fresh herbs, and sometimes saffron, it has a rich, savory taste with hints of spice and warmth. Often served with raita or salad, this dish is loved for its vibrant aroma, colorful presentation, and perfect balance of flavors.</p>
